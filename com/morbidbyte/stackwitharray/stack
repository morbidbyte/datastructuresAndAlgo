Stack charateristics
* Abstract Data Type
* LIFO - Last in, first out
* Push - adds an item as the top item on the stack
* Pop - removes the top item on the stack
* Peek - gets the top item on the stack without popping it.
* Ideal backing data structure: linked list;





Time Complexity

* O(1) for push, pop, and peek when using a linked list
* If you use an array, then push is O(n), because the array may have to be resized
* If you know the maximum number of items that will ever be on the stack, an array can be a good choice
* If memory is tight, an array might be a good choice
* Linked list is ideal.
