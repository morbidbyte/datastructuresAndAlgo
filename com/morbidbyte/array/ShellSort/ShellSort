Variation of Insertio Sort
Insertion sort chooses which element to insert using a gap of 1
Shell Sort starts out using a larger gap value
As the algorithm runs, the gap is reduced
Goal is to reduce the amount of shifting required.


***********************************************************
As the algorithm progresses, the gap is reduced
The last gap value is always 1
A gap value of 1 is equivalent to insertio sort
So, the algorithm does some preliminary work (using gap values greater than 1), and then becomes insertio sort
By the time we get to insertion sort, the array has been partially sorted, so there's less shifting required.

In-place algorithm
Difficult to nail down the time complexity because it will depend on the gap.
Worst case: O(n^2), but it can perform much better than that
Doesn't require as much shifting as insertion sort, so it usually performs better
Unstable algorithm.
