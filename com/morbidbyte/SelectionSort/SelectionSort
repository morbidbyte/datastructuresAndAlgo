In-place algorithm
O(n^2) time complexity - quadratic
It will take 100 steps to sort 10 items, 10,000 steps to sort 100 items, 1,000,000 steps to sort 1000 items
Doesn't require as much swapping as bubble sort
Unstable algorithm

Selection Sort will perform better because we swap only one time per traversal, however keep in mind this is an
unstable algorithm.
